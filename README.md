# Intro
This project is based off the collectible crypto game, CryptoKitties, and utilizes the CryptoKitties API and its contract that is on the Ethereum blockchain
- Tech stack includes Angular, Ionic, Sails.js, Express, Unity, Web3.js
- Each CryptoKitty DNA is converted into a unique ship with a dynamically generated SVG and also translated into the full 3D game. Different colors, models, sizes, and weapons are uniquely determined by the kitties genes.
## Project

This project is divided into three seperate parts.
- [Front-end](https://github.com/ScottMBerger/Blockchain-Ionic-Unity-Game): Made with Angular, Ionic, Socket.io, Web3.js
- [Back-end](https://github.com/ScottMBerger/Blockchain-Ionic-Unity-Game/tree/sails.js-backend-server): Made with Sails.js
- Game: Made with Unity3D


## Development server

- The Ionic development server should be ran using `npm run sails`. This will run the server and output the files to the Sails directory which should be located outside of the Ionic project.
- The Sails.js server can be ran with `npm start`.
